<h3 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h3><br>
<p style="text-align: center;">My name is Jacob Hurley and this is my first professional website. I am new to coding and this is the frame of my website. When my skills improve, I will be able to make the website a lot more polished.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I currently attend <a href="https://www.bishopireton.org/">Bishop Ireton High School</a> located in Alexandria, Virginia. I am going into my senior year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In my free time, I hang out with my friends and play video games. I consider myself introverted but become extroverted when I get to know people.</p>
